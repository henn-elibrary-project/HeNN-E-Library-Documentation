# Documentation
-------------------------------
In HeNN E-LIBRARY PROJECT we have managet two repositories as documentation. One documentation <a href="https://github.com/algosig/LTSPHandBook.git"> LTSPHANDBOOK</a> is completely technical documentation about the E-Library and technologies used in the E-Library.

While this repository HeNN-E-Library Documentation is completely nontechnical but a kind of official draft. This draft will help as terms and guideliens that should be followed by the volunteers during training, monitoring and deployment.

All documentation about Help Nepal Network E-Library Project prepared and compiled by Kathmandu University Open Source Community(KUOSC) Volunteers.

Files in this repository are organized alphabetically in ascending order:
